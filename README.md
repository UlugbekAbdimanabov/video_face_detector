# video_face_detector
Faces appeared in a video will be highlighted with a square around. Change "skip" to adapt it to your video fps.

Notice that using haar algorithm to detect faces is an old algorithm despite it is still used commonly.

I've uploaded it just for educational purpose, because sometimes doing this is also not easy, but if you want a really swift solution use trained `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` model with Dlib (not OpenCV)

Maybe I'll upload fast one too

Good luck!
